The source code of distance measurement with tensor completion
We present an online network-wide distance measurement scheme. In this approach, continuous distance data are structured into sliding-window-based tensors. 
Our method incorporates a lightweight sample selection algorithm with a lowest sampling bound and a rapid, accurate unmeasured data inference algorithm.
